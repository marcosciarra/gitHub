# AngularJS Tree View Directive

File-explorer-like Tree view control for AngularJS and Bootstrap.

## Using the Tree View

In your HTML:

```HTML
<div tree-view="structure" tree-view-options="options"></div>
```

Where `structure` is the JSON model containing the folders and files, and `options` is the tree view configuration. If you don't provide any, the default configuration is used.

Example model and configuration:

```JS
$scope.structure = { folders: [
    { name: 'Folder 1', files: [{ name: 'File 1.jpg' }, { name: 'File 2.png' }], folders: [
        { name: 'Subfolder 1', files: [{ name: 'Subfile 1' }] },
        { name: 'Subfolder 2' },
        { name: 'Subfolder 3' }
    ]},
    { name: 'Folder 2' }
]};

$scope.options = {
    onNodeSelect: function (node, breadcrums) {
        $scope.breadcrums = breadcrums;
    }
};
```
